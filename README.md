# Rebel

Rebel is a framework to make AppKit easier to work with, using categories to fix bugs and make APIs nicer, and new classes to perform common tasks.

This framework is very much a work in progress at the moment, and should be considered **alpha quality**. Breaking changes may happen often during this time.

## Getting Started

To start building the framework, clone this repository and then run `git submodule update --init --recursive`. This will automatically pull down any dependencies.

## Contributing

Fork this repository, make it awesomer (preferably in a branch named for the topic), send a pull request!

All contributions should match our [coding conventions](https://github.com/github/objective-c-conventions).
